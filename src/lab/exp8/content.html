            A truss is a structure comprising one or more triangular units constructed with straight members whose ends are connected at joints referred to as nodes. External forces and reactions to those forces are considered to act only at the nodes and result in forces in the members which are either tensile or compressive forces. Moments (torsional forces) are explicitly excluded because, and only because, all the joints in a truss are treated as revolutes.<br> 
A planar truss is one where all the members and nodes lie within a two dimensional plane, while a space truss has members and nodes extending into three dimensions. A truss is composed of triangles because of the structural stability of that shape and design. A triangle is the simplest geometric figure that will not change shape when the lengths of the sides are fixed. In comparison, both the angles and the lengths of a four-sided figure must be fixed for it to retain its shape.

          1.	Truss Analysis by Method of joints
<br>	If a truss is in equilibrium, then each of its joints must also be in equilibrium.
<br>	The method of joints consists of satisfying the equilibrium conditions for the forces exerted on the pin at each joint of the truss.
<br>	Truss members are all straight two-force members lying in the same plane.
<br>	The force system acting at each pin is coplanar and concurrent (intersecting)
<br>	Rotational or moment equilibrium is automatically satisfied at the joint, only need to satisfy 
<br>? Fx = 0, ? Fy = 0
<br>	Draw the free-body diagram of a joint having at least one known force and at most two unknown forces (may need to first determine external reactions at the truss supports)
<br>	Establish the sense of the unknown forces
<br>	Always assume the unknown member forces acting on the joints free-body diagram to be in tension (pulling on the pin)
<br>	Assume what is believed to be the correct sense of an unknown member force
<br>	In both cases a negative value indicates that the sense chosen must be reversed
<br>	Orient the x and y axes such that the forces can be easily resolved into their x and y components
<br>	Apply ? Fx = 0 and ? Fy = 0 and solve for the unknown member forces and verify their correct sense
